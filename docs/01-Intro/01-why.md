# Golang Intro

Go was developed in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson at Google. It was intended as an alternative to languages like C++ and Java which were used for developing large, scalable systems in the early 2000s.

## Why

* Go was intended to have a simpler syntax than C++ and Java, to increase code readability and maintainability.
* Dissatisfaction of the programming languages existing at that time
* Go aimed to provide faster compilation than C++ and enable the development of fast and efficient applications.
* Use for scalable network services and cloud computing


## Features of Go

* Static typing: Go uses static typing, which can help prevent type-related bugs and increase the readability and maintainability of the code.
* Simple and clean syntax: Go has a simple and easy-to-read syntax, making it easy for developers to understand and write Go code.
* Fast compilation: Go is designed for fast compilation, making it suitable for large-scale projects and for building and deploying microservices.
* Built-in support for networking: Go has built-in support for networking, making it easy to build networked applications such as web servers and clients.
* Cross-platform compatibility: Go can be compiled to run on multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
* Memory management: Go has a built-in garbage collector which automatically manages memory, making it easy to write safe and efficient code.
* Built-in testing: Go has built-in support for testing, making it easy to write unit tests and integration tests for your code.
* Open-source: Go is open-source, which means that anyone can use, modify, and distribute the source code.
* Concurrency: Go uses goroutines to enable concurrent programming
* Object orientation: Go is a functional language, but supports object orientation with interfaces and mixins
* Go has Interfaces, but uses Duck-Typing
